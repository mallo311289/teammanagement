This is a football team management application. When making changes:

1. Only modify files directly related to the requested change
2. Preserve all existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change it
3. Use Tailwind CSS utility classes only (no custom CSS)
4. Use lucide-react icons exclusively
5. All designs should be modern, beautiful, and production-ready
6. Mobile-first responsive design is critical
7. Maintain consistent color scheme: green (#2ECC71) primary, red for matches, blue for training
8. Add smooth transitions and animations to all interactions
9. Use shadcn/ui components when possible
10. Always include proper loading and empty states

When I ask you to add a feature, don't remove or modify existing features unless they conflict.
